# Phase {X}: {Name} Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** {goal from ROADMAP.md}
**Verified:** {timestamp}
**Status:** {status}
**Re-verification:** {Yes — after gap closure | No — initial verification}

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| #   | Truth   | Status     | Evidence       |
| --- | ------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| 1   | {truth} | ✓ VERIFIED | {evidence}     |
| 2   | {truth} | ✗ FAILED   | {what's wrong} |

**Score:** {N}/{M} truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected    | Status | Details |
| -------- | ----------- | ------ | ------- |
| `path`   | description | status | details |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To  | Via | Status | Details |
| ---- | --- | --- | ------ | ------- |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Blocking Issue |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------- |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -------- | ------ |

### Human Verification Required

{Items needing human testing — detailed format for user}
